The website incorporates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing content, allowing for easy customization and updates. </p>
<ul><li>Responsive design: The website adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing on various devices.</li>
  <li>MERN stack: Leveraged the powerful MERN stack for efficient development and scalability.</li>
  <li>Dynamic content: Utilizes React to render dynamic components and manage user interactions.</li>
  <li>CRUD operations: Enables users to create, read, update, and delete project information.</li>

<p align="left">About the project: <br> This project was my first experience working under a mentor in college. The goal was to create a portfolio website for the dean based on his specific criteria. Throughout this project, we learned:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The fundamentals of React and its core functionalities.</li>
  <li>How to build a website from scratch using reusable components.</li>
  <li>The importance of understanding and implementing CRUD operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the project might seem basic, it marked a significant milestone in our learning journey. It provided valuable insights into modern web development and the practical application of the MERN stack.</p>
